NR: To have others work for you
D: To work when you want to 
"NR: To prevent work for work's sake, and to do the minimum necessary for maximum effect (""minimum effective load"")"
D: To retire early or young 
NR: To distribute recovery periods and adventures (mini-retirements) throughout life on a regular basis and recognize that inactivity is not the goal. Doing that which excites you is. 
D: To buy all the things you want to have
"NR: To do all the things you want to do, and be all the things you want to be. If this includes some tools and gadgets, so be it, but they are either means to an end or bonuses, not the focus"
D: To be the boss instead of the employee; to be in charge
"NR: To e neither the boss nor the employee, but the owner. To own the trains and have someone else ensure they run on time."
D: To make a ton of money
"NR: To make a ton of money with specific reasons and defined dreams to chase, timelines and steps included. What are you working for?"
D: To have more
"NR: “To have more quality and less clutter. To have huge financial reserves but recognize that most material wants are justifications for spending time on the things that don’t really matter, including buying things and preparing to buy things. You spent two weeks negotiating your new Infiniti with the dealership and got $10,000 off? That’s great. Does your life have a purpose? Are you contributing anything useful to this world, or just shuffling papers, banging on a keyboard, and coming home to a drunken existence on the weekends?”  "
"D: To reach the big pay-off, whether IPO, acquisition, retirement, or other pot of gold"
"NR: To think big but ensure payday comes every day: cash flow first, big payday second"
D: To have freedom from doing what which you dislike
"NR: “To have freedom from doing that which you dislike, but also the freedom and resolve to pursue your dreams without reverting to work for work’s sake (W4W). After years of repetitive work, you will often need to dig hard to find your passions, redefine your dreams, and revive hobbies that you let atrophy to near extinction. The goal is not to simply eliminate the bad, which does nothing more than leave you with a vacuum, but to pursue and experience the best in the world” "
Challenging the Status Quo vs. Being Stupid:
Retirement is worst-case-scenario insurance
"Interest and energy are cyclical => The NR aims to distribute ""mini-retirements"" throughout life instead of holding the recovery and enjoyment for the fool's gold of retirement. By working only when you are most effective, life is both more productive and more enjoyable"
"Less is not laziness => Doing less meaningless work, so that you can focus on things of greater personal importance, is NOT laziness. This is hard for most to accept, because our culture tends to reward personal sacrifice instead of personal productivity "
"Few people choose to (or are able to) measure the results of their actions and thus measure their contribution in time. More time equals more self-worth and more reinforcement from those above and around them. The NR, despite fewer hours in the office, produce more meaningful results than the next dozen non-NR combined"
"Let’s define “laziness” anew—to endure a non-ideal existence, to let circumstance or others decide life for you, or to amass a fortune while passing through life like a spectator from an office window. The size of your bank account doesn’t change this, nor does the number of hours you log in handling unimportant e-mail or minutiae. Focus on being productive instead of busy"
"The timing is never right => For all of the most important things, the timing always sucks. Waiting for a good time to quit your job? The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up all the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. “Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad. If it’s important to you and you want to do it “eventually,” just do it and correct course along the way."
"Ask for forgiveness, not permission => If it isn’t going to devastate those around you, try it and then justify it. People—whether parents, partners, or bosses—deny things on an emotional basis that they can learn to accept after the fact. If the potential damage is moderate or in any way reversible, don’t give people the chance to say no. Most people are fast to stop you before you get started but hesitant to get in the way if you’re moving. Get good at being a troublemaker and saying sorry when you really screw up"
"Emphasize strengths, don't fix weaknesses => Most people are good at a handful of things and utterly miserable at most. It is far more lucrative and fun to leverage your strengths instead of attempting to fix all the chinks in your armor. The choice is between multiplication of results using strengths or incremental improvements fixing weaknesses that will, at best, become mediocre"
"Things in excess become their opposite: Too much, too many, and too often of what you want becomes what you don't want. This is true of possessions and even time. Lifestyle design is thus not interested in creating an excess of idle time, which is poisonous, bu the positive use of free time, defined simply as doing what you want as opposed to what you feel obligated to do"
"Money alone is not the solution => ""If only I had more money"" is the easiest way to postpone the intense self-examination and decision-making necessary to create a life of enjoyment - now and not later. Busy yourself with the routine of the money wheel, pretend it's the fix-all, and you artfully create a constant distraction that prevents you from seeing just how pointless it is"
"Relative income is more important than absolute income => Absolute income is measured using one holy and inalterable variable: the raw and almighty dollar. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year and is thus twice as rich as John Doe, who makes $50,000 per year. Relative income uses two variables: the dollar and time, usually hours. The whole “per year” concept is arbitrary and makes it easy to trick yourself. Let’s look at the real trade. Jane Doe makes $100,000 per year, $2,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, and works 80 hours per week. Jane Doe thus makes $25 per hour. John Doe makes $50,000 per year, $1,000 for each of 50 weeks per year, but works 10 hours per week and hence makes $100 per hour. In relative income, John is four times richer"
"Distress is bad, eustress is good => Distress refers to harmful stimuli that make you weaker, less confident, and less able. Eustress is stress that is healthful and the stimulus for growth. The NR are equally aggressive in removing distress and finding eustress"
Chapter 3:
"If you are nervous about making the jump or simply putting it off out of fear of the unknown, here is your antidote. Write down your answers, and keep in mind that thinking a lot will not prove as fruitful or as prolific as simply brain vomiting on the page. Write and do note edit - aim for volume. Spend a few minutes on each answer"
"Define your nightmare, the absolute worst that could happen if you did what you are considering. What doubt, fears, and “what-ifs” pop up as you consider the big changes you can—or need—to make? Envision them in painstaking detail. Would it be the end of your life? What would be the permanent impact, if any, on a scale of 1–10? Are these things really permanent? How likely do you think it is that they would actually happen?"
"What steps could you take to repair the damage or get things back on the upswing, even if temporarily? Chances are, it's easier than you imagine. How could you get things back under control?"
"What are the outcomes or benefits, both temporary and permanent, of more probable scenarios? Now that you've defined the nightmare, what are the more probable or definite positive outcomes, whether internal (confidence, self-esteem, etc.) or external? What would the impact of these more-likely outcomes be on a scale of 1-10? How likely is it that you could produce at least a moderately good outcome? Have less intelligent people done this before and pulled it off?"
"If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial control? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1-3 above. If you quit your job to test other options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to?"
"What are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to do. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown outcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do it. I’ll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing most is usually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to do one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and famous businesspeople for advice"
"What is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t only evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost of inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five years, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you and having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill you? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of disappointment and regret, and if we define risk as “the likelihood of an irreversible negative outcome,” inaction is the greatest risk of all"
"What are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected concept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world. Measure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re-pairability of most missteps, and develop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action"
Chapter 4:
Doing the unrealistic is easier than doing the realistic 
"99 percent of people in the world are convinced they are incapable of achieving great things, so they aim for mediocre "
"The level of competition is thus fiercest for ""realistic"" goal, paradoxically making them the most time-and-energy-consuming"
Having an unusually large goal is an adrenaline infusion that provides the endurance to overcome the inevitable trials and tribulations that go along with any goal
"Excitement is the more practical synonym for happiness, and it is precisely what you should strive to chase"
"Excitement is the cure-all. When people suggest you follow your ""passion"" or your ""bliss,"" I propose that they are, in fact, referring to the same singular concept: excitement"
"When asked the question, ""What do you want?"", ask yourself instead, ""What would excite me"""
The steps to start dreamlining:
Shift goals from ambiguous to defined steps
Have goals that are unrealistic to be effective
Focus on activities that will fill the vacuum created when work is removed. Living like a millionaire requires doing interesting things and not just owning enviable things
Chapter 5:
Just a few words on time management: Forget all about it
"In the strictest sense, you shouldn't be trying to do more in each day, trying to fill every second with a work fidget of some type"
Effectiveness is doing the things that get you closer to your goals. Efficiency is performing a given task (whether important or not) in the most economical manner possible. Being efficient without regard to effectiveness is the default mode of the universe
"The mathematical formula he used to demonstrate a grossly uneven but predictable distribution of wealth in society—80% of the wealth and income was produced and possessed by 20% of the population—also applied outside of economics. Indeed, it could be found almost everywhere. Eighty percent of Pareto’s garden peas were produced by 20% of the peapods he had planted, for example"
Ask yourself these two questions and how they can help improve you life:
Which 20% of sources are causing 80% of my problems and unhappiness? 
Which 20% of sources are resulting in 80% of my desired outcomes and happiness?
Slow down and remember this: Most things make no difference
Being busy is a form of laziness - lazy thinking and indiscriminate action
"Being overwhelmed is often as unproductive as doing nothing, and is far more unpleasant"
Being selective - doing less - is the path of the productive
Focus on the important few and ignore the rest
Parkinson's Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) important and complexity in relation to the time allotted for its completion 
There are two synergistic approaches for increasing productivity that are inversions of each other:
Limit tasks to the important to shorten work time (80/20)
Shorten work time to limit tasks to the important (Parkinson's Law)
The best solution is to use both together: Identify the few critical tasks that contribute most to income and schedule them with very short and clear deadlines
"The key to having more time is doing less, and there are two paths to getting there, both of which should be used together:"
Define a to-do list
Define a not-to-do list
"If you had a heart attack and had to work two hours per day, what would you do?"
"I can hear you brain bubbling already: That's ridiculous. Impossible! I know, I know. If I told you that you could survive for months for months, functioning quite well, on four hours of sleep per night, would you believe me? Probably not. Notwithstanding, millions o new mothers do dit all the time "
"If you had a second heart attack and had to work two hours per week, what would you do?"
"If you had a gun to your head and had to stop doing 4/5 of different time-consuming activities, what would you remove?"
"Simplicity requires ruthlessness. If you had to stop time-consuming activities, what would you eliminate to keep the negative effect on income to a minimum? "
What are the top-three activities that I use to fill time to feel as though I've been productive?
"These are usually used to postpone more important actions (often uncomfortable because there is a chance of failure or rejection). Be honest with yourself, as we all do this on occasion. What are your crutch activities?"
"Who are the 20% of people who produce 80% of your enjoyment and propel you forward, and which 20% cause 80% of your depression, anger, and second-guessing?"
Identify these 3 factors: 
"Positive friends versus time-consuming friends: Who is helping versus hurting you, and how do you increase your time with the former while decreasing or eliminating your time with the latter?"
Who is causing me stress disproportionate to the time I spend with them? What will happen if I simply stop interacting with these people? 
"When do I feel starved for time? What commitments, thoughts, and people can I eliminate to fix this problem? "
"Learn to ask, ""If this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?"""
Don't ever arrive at the office or in the front of your computer without a clear list of priorities
There should never be more than two mission-critical items to complete each day
"If you are stuck trying to decide between multiple items that all seem critical, as happens to all of us, look at each in turn and ask yourself, if this is the only thing I accomplish today, will I be satisfied with my day?"
Set a reminder to alert you at least 3 times daily with the question: Are you inventing things to do to avoid the important?
Do not multitask 
Use Parkinson's Law on a Marco and Micro level 
"On a weekly and daily macro level, attempt to take Monday and/or Friday off, as well as leave work at 4 PM. This will focus you to prioritize more effectively and quite possibly develop a social life"
"ON a micro task level, limit the number of items on your to-do list and use impossibly short deadlines to force immediate action while ignoring minutiae "
Stop asking for opinions and start proposing solutions
The first step is to develop a low -information diet 
Go on an immediate one-week media fast
"Develop the habit of asking yourself, ""Will I definitely use this information for something immediate and important?"
Practice the art of nonfinishing
Starting something doesn't automatically justify finishing it
Develop the habit of nonfinishing that which is boring or unproductive if a boss isn't demanding it
"Learn to be difficult when it counts. In school as in life, having a reputation for being assertive will help you receive preferential treatment without having to beg or fight for it every time"
"For our purposes, an interruption is anything that prevents the start-to-finish completion of critical tasks, and there are three principal offenders:"
"Time wasters: those things that can be ignored with little or no consequences. Common time wasters include meetings, discussions, phone calls, web surfing, and e-mail that are unimportant "
"Time consumers: repetitive tasks or requests that need to be completed but often interrupt high-level work. Here are a few you might know intimately: reading and responding to email, making and returning phone calls, customer service, financial or sales reporting, personal errands, all necessary repeated actions and tasks"
"Empowerment failures: instances where someone needs approval to make something small happen. Here are just a. few: fixing customer problems, customer contact, cash expenditures of all types"
Time wasters are the easiest to eliminate and deflect. It is a matter of limiting access and funneling all communication toward immediate action
"First, limit e-mail consumption and production "
"Second, screen incoming and limit outgoing phones calls"
"Third, master the art of refusal and avoid meetings"
It is your job to train those around you to be effective and efficient 
Here are a few recommendations:
"Decide that, given the non-urgent nature of most issues, you will steer people toward the following means of communication, in order of preference: e-mail, phone, and in-person meeting"
Respond to voicemail via e-mail whenever possible 
"Meetings should only be held to make decision about a predefined situation, not to define the problem"
"If you absolutely cannot stop a meeting or call from happening, define the end time"
The cubicle is your temple - don't permit casual visitors
"The cost-and time-effective solution, therefore, is to wait until you have a large order, an approach called ""batching"""
"Batching is also the solution to our distracting but necessary time consumers, those repetitive tasks that interrupt the most important"
Empowerment failure refers to being unable to accomplish a task without first obtaining permission or information 
"Set the rules in your favor: limit access to your time, force people to define their requests before spending time with them, and batch routine menial tasks to prevent postponement of more important projects"
Do not let people interrupt you. Find your focus and you'll find your lifestyle
"To summarize: Create systems to limit your availability via e-mail and phone and deflect inappropriate contact, batch activities to limit setup cost and provide more time for dreamlike milestones, and set or request autonomous rules and guidelines with occasional review of results "
Eliminate before you delegate
Never automate something that can be eliminated and never delegate something that can be automated or streamlined
Principle number one is to refine rules and processes before adding people
Using people to leverage a refined process multiplies production
Using people as a solution to a poor process multiplies problems
"Golden Rule #1: Each delegated task must be both time-consuming and well-defined. If you're running around like a chicken with its head cut off and assign your VA to do that for you, it doesn't improve the order of the universe"
"Golden Rule #2: On a lighter note, have some fun with it. Have someone in Bangalore or Shanghai send e-mails to friends as your personal concierge to set lunch dates or similar basics. Harass your boss with odd phone calls in strong accents from unknown numbers"
Being effective doesn't mean being serious all the time. It's fun being in control for a change. Get a bit of repression off your chest so it doesn't turn into a complex later
Make your money work you and focus on creating an income autopilot
Step One: Pick an affordably reachable niche market
"Creating demand is hard. Filling demand is much easier. Don't create a product, then seek someone to sell it to"
Find a market - define your customers - then find or develop a product for them
Ask yourself the following questions to find profitable niches:
"Which social, industry and professional groups do you belong to, have you belonged to, or do you understand, whether dentists, engineers, rock climbers, recreational cyclists, car restoration aficionados, dancers, or other?"
Which of the groups you identified have their own magazines? 
"Pick the two markets that you are most familiar with that have their own magazines with full-page advertising that costs less than $5,000. There should be no fewer than 15,000 readers"
The goal is to come up with well-formed product ideas and spend nothing
The main benefit should be encapsulated in one sentence 
People can dislike you - and you often sell more by offending some - but they should never misunderstand you
It should cost the customer $50-200
"There are three main benefits to creating a premium, high-end image and charging more than the competition:"
1. Higher pricing means that we can sell fewer units- and thus manage fewer customers - and fulfill our dreamlines. It's faster
"2. Higher pricing attract lower-maintenance customers (better credit, fewer complaints/questions, fewer returns, etc.). It's less headache. This is HUGE"
3. Higher pricing also creates higher profit margins. It's safer
It should take no more than 3 to 4 weeks to manufacture 
This is critically important for keeping costs low an adapting to sales demand without stockpiling product in advance
It should be fully explainable in a good online FAQ
"Understanding these criteria, a question remains: ""How does one obtain a good muse product that satisfies them?"" There are three options we'll cover in ascending order of recommendation"
Option One: Resell a product
Purchasing an existing product at wholesale and reselling it is the easiest route but also the least profitable 
"To purchase at wholesale, use these steps: "
"1. Contact the manufacturer and request a ""wholesale priceless"" (generally 40% off retail) and terms"
"2. If a business tax ID number is needed, print out the proper forms from your state’s Secretary of State website and file for an LLC (which I prefer) or similar protective business structure for $100–200"
Option Two: License a product
Some of the world's best-known brans and products have been borrowed from someone or somewhere else
"There are two parties involved in a licensing deal, and a member of the New Rich could be either "
"First, there is the inventor of the product, called the ""licensor,"" who can sell others the right to manufacture, use, or sell his or her product, usually for 3-10% of the wholesale price (usually around 40% off retail) for each unit sold"
The other side of the equation is the person interested in manufacturing and selling the inventor's product for 90-97% of the profit: the licensee
Option Three: Create a Product
Creating a product is not complicated
"""Create"" sounds more involved than it actually is. If the idea is a hard product - an invention - it is possible to hire mechanical engineers or industrial designers on www.elance.com to develop a prototype based on your description of its function and appearance, which is then taken to a contract manufacturer "
"Putting mechanical devices aside and forgetting about welding and engineering, there is one class of product that meets of our criteria, has a manufacturing lead time of less than a week in small quantities, and often permits not just an 8-10x markup, but a 20-50x markup"
That class of products is information 
"Information products are low-cost, fast to manufacture, and time-consuming for competitors to duplicate"
Information is too time-consuming for most knock-off artists to bother with when there are easier products to replicate 
"If you aren't an expert then, don't sweat it"
"First, ""expert"" in the context of selling product means that you know more about the topic than the purchaser "
"Second, expert status can be created in less than four weeks if you understand basic credibility indicators "
The degree to which you personally need expert status also depends on how you obtain your content. There are three main options:
"1. Create the content yourself, often via paraphrasing and combining points from several books on a topic"
"2. Repurpose content that is in the public domain and not subject to copyright protection, such as government documents and material that predates modern copyright law"
"3. License content or compensate an expert to help create content. Fees can be one-time and paid up front or royalty-based (5-10% of net revenue, for example) "
Use the following questions to brainstorm potential how-to or informational products that can be sold to your markets using your expertise or borrowed expertise 
"1. How can you tailor a general skill for your market - what I call ""niching down"" - or add to what is being sold successfully in your target magazines? think narrow and deep rather than broad"
"2. What skills are you interested in that you - and others in your markets - would pay to learn? Become an expert in this skill for yourself and then create a product to teach the same. If you need help or want to speed up the process, consider the next question"
"3. What experts could you interview and record to create a sellable audio CD? These people do not need to be the best, but just better than most. Offer them a digital master copy of the interview to do with or sell as they like and/or offer them a small up-front or ongoing royalty payment"
"4. Do you have a failure-to-success story that could be turned into a how-to product for others? Consider problems you've overcome in the past, both professional and personal"
How to become a top expert in 4 weeks:
1. Join two or three related trade organizations with official sounding names
2. Read the three top-selling books on your topic and summarize each on one page
"3. Give one free one-to-three-hour seminar at the closest well-known university, using posters to advertise. Then do the same at branches of two well-known big companies located in the same area. Tell the company that you have been given seminars at University X or X College and are a member of those groups from step 1"
"4. Optional: Offer to write one or two articles for trade magazines related to your topics, citing what you have accomplished in steps 1 and 3 for credibility "
"5. Join ProfNet, which is a service that journalists use to find experts to quote for articles "
Intuition and experience are poor predictors of which products and businesses will be profitable 
"To get an accurate indicator of commercial viability, don't ask people if they would buy - ask them to buy "
The response to the second is the only one that matters. The approach of the NR reflects this
Step Three: Micro-Test your products
Micro-testing involves using inexpensive advertisements to test consumer response to a product prior to manufacturing 
We'll test the product ideas from the last chapter on Google Adwords in five days for $500 or less
The basic test processes consists of three parts:
1. Best: Look at the competition and create a more-compelling offer on a basic one-to-three-page website 
2. Test the offer using short Google Adwords advertising campaigns (three hours to set up and five days of passive observation)
Divest or Invest: Cut losses with losers and manufacture the winner(s) for sales rollout
Starting with the end in mind - an organizational map of what the eventual business will look like - is not new
Removing yourself from the equation: When and How
"1. Contract outsourcing companies that specialize in one function vs. freelancers whenever possible so that if someone is fired, quits, or doesn't perform, you can replace them without interrupting your business"
"2. Ensure that all outsourcers are willing to communicate among themselves to solve problems, and give them written permission to make most inexpensive decisions without consulting you first"
The alternative to binge travel - the mini-retirement - entails relocating to one place for one to six months before going home or moving to another locale 
"Though it can be relaxing, the mini-retirement is not an escape from your life but a reexamination of it - the creation of a blank state"
The mini-retirement is defined as recurring - it is a lifestyle 
True freedom is much more than having enough income and time to do what you want. It is quite possible - actually the rule rather than the exception - to have financial and time freedom but still be caught in the throes of the rat race
"One cannot be free from the materialistic addictions, time-famine mind-set, and comparative impulses that crated it in the first place "
Learn to slow down. Get lost intentionally. Observe how you judge both yourself and those around you
Most excuses not to travel are exactly that - excuses  
How do you overcome the fear of traveling with your children: 
"1. Before embarking on a long international trip with your children for the first time, take a trial run for a few weeks"
"2. For each stop, arrange a week of language classes that begin upon arrival and take advantage of transportation from the airport if available"
When More is Less: Cutting the Clutter
"Whether you're aware of it or not, this clutter creates indecision and distractions, consuming attention and making unfettered happiness a real chore"
Filling the Void
I've got more money and time than I ever dream possible ... why am I depressed? 
Common doubts and self-flagellation include the following: 
"1. Am I really doing this to be more free and lead a better life, or am I just lazy?"
"2. Did I quit the rat race because it's bad, or just because I couldn't hack it? Did I just cop out?"
3. Is this as good as it gets? Perhaps I was better of when I was following orders and ignorant of the possibilities. It was easier at least 
4. Am I really successful or just kidding myself?
"5. Have I lowered my standards to make myself a winner? Are my friends, who are not making twice as much as three years ago, really on the right track? "
6. Why am I not happy? I can do anything and I'm still not happy. Do I even deserve it? 
"More of this can be overcome as soon as we recognize it for what it is: outdated comparisons using the more-is-better and money-as-sucess mind-sets that got us into trouble to begin with. Even so, there is a more profound observation to be made"
"Lacking an external focus, the mind turns inward on itself and creates problems to solve, even if the problems are undefined or unimportant"
"If you find a focus, an ambitious goal that seems impossible and forces you to grow, these doubts disappear "
"In the process of searching for a new focus, it is almost inevitable that the ""big"" question will creep in. Two popular examples are ""What is the meaning of life?"" and ""What is the point of it all?"""
"There are many more, ranging from the introspective to the ontological, but I have one answer for almost all of them - I don't answer them at all"
"Before spending time on a stress-inducing question, big or otherwise, ensure that the answer is ""yes"" to the following two questions: "
1. Have I decided on a single meaning for each term in this question? 
2. Can an answer to this question be acted upon to improve things? 
"If you can't define it or act upon it, forget it"
Sharpening your logical and practical mental toolbox is not ben an atheist or unspiritual. It's not being crass and it's not being superficial. It's being smart and putting your effort where it can make the biggest difference for yourself and others
There are two components that are fundamental in enjoying life: continual learning and service 
"Though you can upgrade your brain domestically, traveling and relocating provides unique conditions that progress much faster "
"Language learning deserves special mention. It is, bar none, the best thing you can do to hone clear thinking "
Acquiring a new language makes you aware of your own language: your own thoughts 
Gain a language and you gain a second lens through which to question and understand the world
Service to me is simple: doing something that improves life besides your own
Service is an attitude. Find the cause or vehicle that interests you most and make no apologies 
Mistake are the name of the game in lifestyle design. It requires fighting impulse after impulse from the old world of retirement-based life deferral. Here are the slipups you will make. Don't get frustrated. It's all part of the process
"1. Losing sight of dreams and falling into work for work's sake (W4W). Please reread the introduction and next chapter of this book whenever you feel yourself falling into this trap. Everyone does it, but many get stuck and never get out"
"2. Micromanaging and e-mailing to fill time. Set the responsibilities, problem scenarios and rules, and limits of autonomous decision-making - then stop, for the sanity of everyone involved"
3. Handling problems your outsources or co-workers can handle
"4. Helping outsourcers or co-workers with the same problem more than once, or with non-crisis problems "
"Chasing customers, particularly unqualified or international prospects, when you have sufficient cash flow to finance your non financial pursuits "
Answering e-mail that will not result in a sale or that can be answered by a FAQ or auto-responder 
"Working where you live, sleep, or should relax "
Not performing a thorough 80/20 analysis every two to four weeks for your business and personal life 
"Striving for endless perfection rather than great or simply good enough, whether in your personal or professional life "
Blowing minutiae and small problems out of proportion as an excuse to work 
Making non-time-sensitive issues urgent in order to justify work 
"Viewing one product, job or project as the end-all and be-all of your existence "
Ignoring the social rewards of life 
"Time without attention is worthless, so value attention over time"
Here are a few question that can help you pop on the productivity blinders and put things in perspective 
"1. What is the one goal, if completed, that could change everything? "
"2. What is the most urgent thing right now that "" you feel you ""must"" or ""should"" do? "
"3. Can you let the urgent ""fail"" - even for a day - to get to the next milestone for your potential life-changing tasks? "
4. What's been on your to-do list the longest? Start it first thing in the morning and don't allow interruptions or lunch until you finish
"Oftentimes, in order to do the big things, you have to let the small bad things happen"
Make this trade a habit. Let the small bad things happen and make the big good things happen
