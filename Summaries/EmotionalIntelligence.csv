Intelligence can come to nothing when the emotions hold sway
"All emotions are, in essence, impulses to act, the instant plans for handling life that evolution has instilled in us"
"In many or most moments, the two minds are exquisitely coordinated: feelings are essential to thought, thought to feeling"
"One, the rational mind, is the mode of comprehension we are typically conscious of: more prominent in awareness, thoughtful, able to ponder and reflect"
"In a very real sense we have two minds, one that thinks and one that feels"
The fact that the thinking brain grew from the emotional reveals much about the relationship of thought to feeling; there was an emotional brain long before there was a rational one
The neocortex is the seat of thought; it contains the centers that put together and comprehend what the senses perceive
"As we shall see, the workings of the amygdala and its interplay with the neo-cortex are at the heart of emotional intelligence"
"But alongside that there is another system of knowing: impulsive and powerful, if sometimes illogical - the emotional mind"
"As the limbic system evolved, the limbic system refined two power tools: learning and memory"
Several new layers of brain cells were added to form the neocortex
"While the hippo campus remembers the drys facts, the amygdala retains the emotional flavor that goes with those facts"
"The amygdala's extensive web of neural connections allows it, during an emotional emergency, to capture an drive much of the rest of the brain - including the rationalmind"
"The key ""off switch"" for distressing emotion seems to be the left prefrontal lobe"
"In a sense we have two brains, two minds - and two different kinds of intelligence: rational and emotional"
Emotional hijackings presumably involve two dynamics: triggering of the amygdala and a failure to activate the neocortical processes that usually keep emotional response in balance
"The left prefrontal lobe, in short, seems to be part of a neural circuit that can switch off, or at least dampen down, all but the strongest negative surges of emotion"
"Intra-personal intelligence, the key to self-knowledge, he included ""across to one's own feelings and the ability to discriminate among them and draw upon them to guide behavior"""
"Psychology is coming to appreciate the power and virtues of emotions in mental life, as well as their dangers."
Emotional intelligence can be split into 5 main domains
- Knowing one's emotions
"	- Self-awareness - recognizing a feeling as it happens - is the keystone of emotional intelligence"
"	- Handling feelings so they are appropriate is an ability that builds on self-awareness"
"Self-awareness, in short, means being ""aware of both our mood and our thoughts about our mood"""
People tend to fall into distinctive styles for attending to and dealing with their emotions
"	- Aware of their moods as they are having them, these people understandably have some sophistication about 		their emotional lives"
"	- These are people who often feel swamped by their emotions and helpless to escape them"
"	- While these people are often clear about what they are feeling, they also tend to be accepting of their moods, 		and so don't try to change them"
"Diener finds that women, in general, feel both positive and negative emotions more strongly than do men"
"Interpersonal intelligence includes the ""capacities to discern and respond appropriately to the moods, temperaments, motivations, and desires of other people"""
"People with well-developed emotional skills are also more likely to be content and effective in their lives, mastering the habits of mind that foster their own productivity"
"- While strong feelings can create havoc in reasoning, the lack of awareness of feeling can also be ruinous,"
The emotional brain is as involved in reasoning as is the thinking brain
One lesson from Elliot's indecisiveness is the crucial role of feeling in navigating the endless stream of life's personal decisions.
especially in weighing the decisions on which our destiny largely depends
"As Freud made clear, much of emotional life is unconscious"
Any emotion can be - and often is - unconscious
"There are two levels of emotion, conscious and unconscious"
"When the body is already in a state of edginess, and something triggers an emotional hijacking, the subsequent emotion is of especially great intensity"
The physiological beginnings of an emotion typically occur before a person is consciously aware of the feeling itself
"A sense of self-mastery, of being able to withstand the emotional storms that the buffeting of fortune brings rather than being ""passion's slave,"" has been praised a virtue since the time of Plato"
Anxiety comes in two forms: cognitive (worrisome thoughts) and somatic (physiological symptoms)
heir beginning as possible
One of the main determinants of whether a depressed mood will persists or lift is the degree to which people ruminate
Trice found that reframing a situation more positively was one of the most potent ways to put anger to rest
"One way to defuse anger is to seize on and challenge the thoughts that trigger the surges of anger, since it is the original appraisal of an interaction that confirms and encourages the first burst of anger, and the subsequent reappraisals that the fan the flames"
It's hard to stay angry when we're having a pleasant time
"""Goal-directed self-imposed delay of gratification"" is perhaps the essence of emotional self-regulation: the ability to deny impulse in the service of a goal"
Worry is the nub of anxiety's damaging effect on mental performance of all kind
"Good moods, enhance the ability to think flexibly and with more complexity, thus making it easier to find solution to problems, whether intellectual or interpersonal"
Wenzlaff added that the most effective distractions are ones that will shift your mood
"‚ÄúStudies of Olympic athletes, world-class musicians, and chess grand masters find their unifying trait is the ability to motivate themselves to pursue relentless training routines‚Äù"
"When emotions overwhelm concentration, what is being swamped is the mental capacity cognitive scientists call ""working memory,"" the ability to hold in mind all information relevant to the task at hand"
"Having hope means that one will not give in to overwhelming anxiety, a defeatist attitude, or depression in the face of difficult challenges or setsbacks"
"People who are hopeful evidence less depression than others as they maneuver through life in pursuit of their goals, are less anxious in general, and have fewer emotional distresses"
"When you compare students of equivalent intellectual aptitude on their academic achievements, what sets them apart is hope"
"As with hope, optimism predicts academic success"
"Flow is a state of self-forgetfulness, the opposite of rumination and worry"
People's beliefs about their abilities have a profound effect on those abilities
Being able to enter flow is emotional intelligence at its best
One way to enter the flow is to intentionally focus a sharp attention on the task at hand
It can be argued that mastery in a craft or skill is spurred on by the experience of flow - that the motivation to get better and better at something is at least in part to stay in flow while doing it
"Empathy builds on self-awareness; the more open we are to our own emotions, the more skilled we will be in reading feelings"
"Just as the mode of the rational mind is words, the mode of the emotions is nonverbal"
"Empathy stemmed from a sort of physical imitation of the distress of another, which then evokes the same feelings in oneself"
"Stern is fascinated by the small, repeated exchanges that take place between parent and child; he believes that the most basic lessons of emotional life are laid down in these intimate moments"
"Of all such moments, the most critical are those that let the child know his/her emotions are met with empathy, accepted, and reciprocated, in a process called attunement"
"This suggests that when the emotional brain is driving the body with a strong reaction, there can be little or no empathy"
Prolonged absence of attunement between parent and child takes a tremendous emotional toll on the child
Empathy is a given of biology
Empathy requires enough calm and receptivity so that the subtle signals of feeling from another person can be received and mimicked by one's own emotional brain
Emotions are contagious
"We send emotional signals in every encounter, and those signals affect those we are with; the more adroit we are socially, the better we control the signals we send"
Being able to manage emotions in someone else is the core of the art of handling relationships
One key social competence is how well or poorly people express their own feelings
"When two people interact, the direction of mood transfer is from the one who is more forceful in expressing feelings to the one who is more passive"
Coordination of moods is the essence of rapport
Emotional entrainment is the heart of influence
"Setting the emotional tone of an interaction is, in a sense, a sign of dominance at a deep and intimate level: it means driving the emotional state of the other person"
The four components of interpersonal intelligence
"	- Involves initiating and coordinating the efforts of a network of people"
"One determinant of interpersonal effectiveness is how deftly carry out this emotional synchrony. If they are adept at attuning to people's moods, or can easily bring others under the sway of their own, then their interactions will go more smoothly at the emotional level"
"	- Preventing conflicts or resolving those that flare up"
The flow model suggests that achieving mastery of any skill or body of knowledge should ideally happen naturally
"	- Empathy and connecting"
"	- Able to detect and have insights about people's feelings, motives, and concerns"
"If the above interpersonal abilities are not balanced by an astute sense of one's own needs and feelings and how to fulfill them, they can lead to a hollow social success - a popularity won at the cost of one's true satisfaction"
"If you make mistakes in what emotional messages you send, you constantly experience that people react to you in funny ways - you get rebuffed and don't know why"
"If the test of social skill is the ability to calm distress emotions in others, then handling someone at the peak of rage is perhaps the ultimate measure of mastery"
"The martial endgame reflects the fact that there are, in effect, two emotional realities in a couple, his and hers"
The two cardinal sins that almost always lead to rejection are trying to take the lead too soon and being out of synch with the frame of reference
"""... men and women want and expect very different things out of a conversation, with men content to talk about ""things"", while women seek emotional connection"
"Women, on average, experience the entire range of emotions with greater intensity and more volatility than men - in this sense, women are more ""emotional"" than men"
The slowness of men to bring up problems in a relationship is no doubt compounded by their relative lack of skill when it comes to reading facial expressions of emotions
"Specific issues such as how to discipline the children, or how much debt and savings a couple feels comfortable with are not what make or break a marriage. Rather, it is how a couple discusses such sore points that matters more for the fate of their marriage"
Simply having reached an agreement about how to disagree is key to martial survival
An early warning signal that a marriage is in danger is harsh criticism
Gottman uses the apt term flooding for the susceptibility to frequent emotional distress
"Women, on average, do not mind plunging into the unpleasantness of a martial squabble nearly so much as do the men in their lives"
"For men, the advice is not to sidestep conflict, but to realize that when their wife brings up some grievance or disagreement, she may be doing it as an act of love, trying to keep the relationship healthy and on course"
Men also need to be on guard against short-circuiting the discussion by offering a practical solution too early on -- it's typically more important to a wife that she feel her husband hears her complaint and empathizes with her feelings about the matter (though he need not agree with her)
"Wives need to make a purposeful effort to be careful not to attack their husbands - to complain about what they did, but not criticize them as a person or express contempt"
Most notably missing in couples who eventually divorce are attempts by either partner in an argument to de-escalate the tension
"One overall strategy for making a marriage work is not to concentrate on the specific issues, but rather cultivate a couple's shared emotional intelligence, thereby improving the chances of working things out"
Every strong emotion has at its root an impulse to action; managing those impulses is basic to emotional intelligence
One key martial competence is for partners to learn to soothe their own distressed feelings
"Empathy deteriorates when one's own feelings are so strong that they allow no physiological harmonizing, but simply override everything else"
Listening is a skill that keeps couples together
Let me make my point by tracking the difference three applications of emotional intelligence make
"The most powerful form of nondefensive listening, of course, is empathy: actually hearing the feelings behind what is being said"
"Finally, respect and love disarm hostility in marriage, as elsewhere in life"
An artful critique focuses on what a person has done and can do rather than reading mark of character into a job poorly done
"The basic belief that leads to optimism, remember, is that setbacks or failures are due to circumstances that we can do about to change them for the better"
Art of Praise
"The repair mechanisms that keep an argument from escalating into a dire explosion are simple moves such as keeping the discussion on track, empathizing, and tension reduction"
"	- Pick a significant incident, an event that illustrates a key problem that needs changing or a pattern of 		   deficiency"
"	- Focus on the specifics, saying what the person did well, what was done poorly, and how it could be changed"
"	- The critique, like all useful feedback, should point to a way to fix the problem"
"	- Critique, like praise, are most effective face to face and in private"
"	- This is a call for empathy, for being attuned to the impact of what you say and how you say it on the person 		at the receiving end"
"Prejudices are a kind of emotional learning that occurs early in life, making these reactions especially hard to eradicate entirely, even in people who as adults feel it is wrong to hold them"
"If people's long-held biases cannot be so easily weeded out, what can be changed is what they do about them"
"Here too the skills of emotional intelligence are an advantage, especially in having the social knack to know not just when but how to speak up productively against bias"
"The single most important element in group intelligence, it turns out, is not the average IQ int he academic sense, but rather in terms of emotional intelligence"
The key to a high group IQ is social harmony
"It is the ability to harmonize that, all other things being equal, will make one group especially talented, productive, and successful, and another - with members whose talent and skill are equal in other regards -- do poorly"
"The single most important factor in maximizing the excellence of a group's product was the degree to which the members were able to create a state of internal harmony, which lets them take advantage of the full talent of their members"
"	- Based on which people are turned to for advice"
"One of the most important things that ""stars"" had turned out be a rapport with a network of key people"
There are three varieties of informal networks
"The starts of an organization are often those who have thick connections on all networks, whether communications, expertise, or trust"
"	- Who talk to whom"
"By now a scientific case can be made that there is a margin of medical effectiveness, both in prevention and treatment, that can be gained by treating people's emotional state along with their medical condition"
Anxiety - the distress evoked by life's pressures - is perhaps the emotion with the greatest weight of scientific evidence connecting it to the onset of sickness and course of recovery
The toll on anxiety is not just that is lowers the immune response; other research is showing adverse effects on the cardiovascular system
"People who have a great deal of hopefulness are, understandably, better able to bear up under trying circumstances, included medical difficulties"
Add the sounds of silence to the list of emotional risks to health - and close emotional tis to the list of protective factors
The quality of relationships as well as their sheer number seems key to buffering stress
"Helping people better manage their upsetting feelings - anger, anxiety, depress, pessimism, and loneliness - is a form of disease prevention"
Studies done over two decades involving more than thirty-seven thousand people who that social isolation - the sense that you have nobody with whom you can share your private feelings or have close contact - doubles the chances of sickness or death
Many patients can benefit measurably when their psychological needs are attended to along with their purely medical ones
"Though some emotional skills are honed with friends through the years, emotionally adept parents can do much to help their children with each of the basics of emotional intelligence: learning how to recognized, manage, and harness their feelings; empathizing; and handling the feelings that arise in their relationships"
A child's readiness for school depends on the most basic of knowledge
"	- A sense of control and mastery of one's body, behavior, and world; the child's sense that he is more likely 		than not to succeed at what he undertakes, and that adults will be helpful"
"	- The sense that finding out about things is positive and leads to pleasure"
"	- The wish and capacity to have an impact, and to act upon that with persistence. This is related to a sense of 		competence, of being effective"
"	- The ability to modulate and control one's own actions in age-appropriate ways; a sense of inner control"
"	- The ability to engage with others based on the sense of being understood by and understanding others"
"	- The wish and ability to verbally exchange ideas, feelings, and concepts with others. This is related to a sense 		of trust in others and of pleasure in engaging with others, including adults"
"	- The ability to balance one's own needs with those of others in group activity"
Perhaps the most instructive paradigm for understanding the emotional learning such abused children have undergone
s in seeing how trauma can leave a lasting imprint on the brain - and how even these savage imprints can be mended
"If people feel there is something they can do in a catastrophic situation, some control they can exert, not matter how minor, they fare far better emotionally than do those who feel utterly helpless"
"Over the course of long-term psychotherapy, patients made two kinds of changes:"
"- Their emotional reaction to the triggering events became less distressing, even calm or bemused, and their overt 	   responses became more effective in getting what they truly wanted from the relationship"
Temperament can be defined in terms of the moods that typify our emotional life
"Kagan posits that there are at least four temperamental types: timid, bold, upbeat, and melancholy"
Kagan finds that children who are overly sensitive and fearful grow into shy and timorous adults
"The tendency toward a melancholy or upbeat temperament - like that toward timidity or boldness - emerges within the first year of life, a fact that strongly suggests it too is genetically determined"
"From observations of those once-fearful cihldren at home, it is clear that parents, and especailly mothers, play a major role in whether an innately timid child grows bolder with time or continues to shy away from novelty and become upset by challenge"
"""It appears that mothers who protect their highly reactive infants form frustration and anxiety in the hope of effecting a benevolent outcome seem to exacerbate the infant's uncertainty and produce the opposite effect"""
"""Those children who had become less timid by kindergarten seem to have had parents who put gentle pressure on them to be more outgoing"""
One of the signs that a timid child will be more likely to overcome this natural inhibition is having a higher level of social competence
"With each area of the brain develops at a different rate during childhood, the onset of puberty marks one of the most sweeping periods of pruning throughout the brain"
The habits of emotional management that are repeated over and over again during childhood and the teenage years will themselves help mold this circuitry
"This makes childhood a crucial window of opportunity for shaping lifelong emotional propensities; habits acquired in childhood become set in the basic synaptic wiring of neural architecture, and are harder to change later in life"
"One of the most essential emotional lessons, first learned in infancy and refined throughout childhood, is how to soothe oneself when upset"
"- For very young infants, soothing comes from caretakers: a mother hears her infant crying, picks him up, holds 	and rocks him until he calms down"
"Educators, long disturbed by school children's lagging scores in math and reading, are realizing there is a different and more alarming deficiency: emotional illiteracy"
"Another key circuit that continues to shape itself through childhood centers on the vagus nerve, which at one end regulates heart and other parts of the body, and at the other sends signals to the amygdala from the adrenals, prompting it to secrete the catecholamines, which prime the fight-or-flight response"
The most common cause of disability among teenagers is mental illness
"Thus while children in poverty have the worst record on indices of emotional skills, their rate of deterioration over the decades was no worse than for middle-class children or for wealthy children: all show the same steady slide"
"Particularly in young people, problems in relationships are a trigger for depression"
"Each successive generation worldwide since the opening of the century has lived with a higher risk than their parents of suffering a major depression - not just sadness, but a paralyzing listlessness, dejection, and self-pity, and an overwhelming hopelessness - over the course of life"
"That depression should not just be treated, but prevented, in children is clear form an alarming discovery"
Children who are most prone to melancholy tend toward this pessimistic outlook before they become depressed
In more and more families there has been growing parental indifference to children's needs as they grow up
"- But over and above these temperamental factors, it is children who are ""off - whose awkwardness repeatedly   	  makes people uncomfortable - who tend to be shunted aside"
"- Early emotional stressors may affect neuron development, which can lead to a depression when you are under 	  great stress even decades later"
distressed them for years
Two kinds of emotional proclivities lead children to end up as social outcasts
There are two emotional pathways to alcoholism
Those most vulnerable to addiction seem to find in the drug or alcohol an instant way to soothe emotions that have
Certain emotional patterns seem to make people more likely to find emotional relief in one substance rather than another
"- One starts with someone who has highly-strung and anxious in childhood, who typically discovers as a teenager 	   that alcohol will calm the anxiety"
"	- A winning sociability that draws people to them"
"	 -Self-confidence"
"	- An optimistic persistence in the face of failure and frustration"
A new look at the causes of depression in the young pinpoints deficits in two areas of emotional competence:
"	- An easygoing nature"
"Long-term studies of hundreds of children brought up in poverty, in abusive families, or by a parent with severe mental illness show that those who are resilient even in the face of the most grinding hardships tend to share key emotional skills"
- These include:
"	- The ability to recover quickly from upsets"
Mastery in the emotional domain is especially difficult because skills need to be acquired when people are usually least able to take in new information and learn new habits of response - when they are upset
"- Managing emotions and realizing what is behind a feeling and learning ways to handle anxieties, anger, and 	   sadness"
The topics taught at Self Science Nueva Learning Center include:
"	- Self-awareness also takes the form of recognizing your strengths and weaknesses"
"	- Seeing yourself in a positive but realistic light"
"- Learning empathy and understanding others' feelings and taking their perspective, and respecting differences in 	   how people feel about things"
Emotional literacy programs improve children's academic achievement scores and school performance
"The bedrock of character is self-discipline; the virtuous life, as philosophers since Aristotle have observed, is based on self-control"
A related keystone of character is being able to motivate and guide oneself
"""It takes will to keep emotion under control of reason"""
