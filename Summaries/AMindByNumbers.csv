"Our brain uses two very different processes for thinking - the focused and diffuse modes. It seems you toggle back and forth between these modes, using one or the other "
Use the focused mode to first start grappling with concepts and problems in math and science
It is typical to be stumped by new concepts and problems when we first focus on them
"After you've done your first hard focused work, allow the diffuse mode to take over. Relax and do something different! "
"The Einstellung effect refers to getting stuck in solving a problem or understanding a concept as a result of becoming fixated on a flawed approach. Switching modes from focused to diffuse can help; free you from this effect. Keep in mind, then, that sometimes you will need to be flexible in your thinking. You may need to switch modes to solve a problem or understand a concept. Your initial ideas about problem solving can sometimes be very misleading "
"When frustration arises, it's time to switch your attention to allow the diffuse mode to begin working in the background "
It's best to work at math and science in small doses - a little every day. This gives both the focused and diffuse modes the time they need to do their thing so you can understand what you are learning. That's how solid neural structures are built
"If procrastination is an issue, try setting a timer for twenty-five minutes and focusing intently on your task without allowing yourself to be drawn aside by text messages, web surfing, or router attractive distractions "
"To figure out new ideas and solve problem, it's important not only to focus initially, but also to subsequently turn our focus away from what we want to learn "
There are two major memory systems: Working memory and Long-term memory
"Long-term memory is like a storage warehouse that can hold large amounts of material, but needs to be revisited occasionally to keep the memories accessible"
Spaced repetition helps move items from working memory to long-term memory
Sleep helps you do 3 things:
Working memory is like a juggler who can keep only four items in the air
Sleep is a critical part of the learning process
Make the neural connections needed for normal thinking processes - which is why sleep the night before a test is so important
Strengthen and rehearse the important parts of what you are learning and prune away trivialities
"Practice helps build strong neural patterns - that is, conceptual chunks of understanding"
"Chunks are best built with: focused attention, understanding the basic idea, and practice to help you gain big-picture context"
Simple recall - trying to remember the key points without look at the page - is one of the best ways to help the chunking process along
Figure out tough problems and find meaning in what you are learning
Practice gives you the mental fluidity and agility you need for tests
We procrastinate about the things that make us feel uncomfortable. But what makes us feel good temporarily isn't necessarily good for us in the long run
Procrastination can be like taking tiny amounts of poison. It may not seem harmful at the time. But the long-term effects can be very damaging
A little bit of work on something that feels painful can ultimately be very beneficial
"Habits such as procrastination have four parts: The cue, the routine, the reward, and the belief"
"Change a habit by responding differently to a cue, or even avoiding that cue altogether. Reward and belief make the change long-lasting "
Focus on the process ( the way you spend you time) instead of the product (what you want to accomplish)
Use the twenty-five-minute Pomodoro to stay productive for brief periods. Then reward yourself after each successful period of focused attention
Be sure to schedule free time to nurture your diffuse mode
Mental contrasting is a powerful motivation technique - think about the worst aspects of your present or past experiences and contrast these with the upbeat vision of your future
"Multitasking means that you are not able to make full, rich connections in your thinking, because the part of your brain that helps make connections is constantly being pulled away before neural connections can be firmed up "
Chunking means integration a concept into one smoothly connected neural though pattern
Chunking helps increase the amount of working memory you have available
Building a chunked library of concepts and solutions helps build intuition in problem solving
"When you are building a chunked library, it's important to keep deliberate focus on some of the toughest concepts and aspects of problem solving "
"Occasionally you can study hard and fate deals a bad hand. But remember the Law of Serendipity: If you prepare well by practicing and building a good mental library, you will find that luck will be increasingly on your side. In other words, you guarantee failure if you don't try, but those who consistently give it a good effort will experience many more successes "
Mental tricks can be powerful tools. The following are some of the most effective:
"If your attitude is troubled, reframe your focus to shift attention from the negative to the positive "
"Put yourself in a place with few interruptions, such as a library, to help with procrastination"
Practice ignoring distracting thoughts by simply letting them drift past
Realize it's perfectly normal to sit down with a few negative feelings about beginning your work
"Planning your life for ""playtime"" is one of the most important things you can do to prevent procrastination, and one of the most important reasons to avoid procrastination "
"At the heart of procrastination prevention is a reasonable daily to-do list, with a weekly once-over to ensure you're on track from big-picture perspective "
Keep a planner-journal so you can easily track when you reach your goals and observe what does and doesn't work
Write your daily task list the evening before
Commit yourself to certain routines and tasks each day
"Write your planned tasks out the night before, so your brain has time to dwell on your goals to help ensure success"
Deliberately delay rewards until you have finished a task
"Obstacles arise, but don't make a practice of blaming all your problems on external factors. If everything is always somebody else's fault, it's time to start looking in the mirror "
Arrange your work into a series of small challenges. Always make sure you (and your zombies!) get lots of rewards. Take a few minutes to savor the feelings of happiness and triumph
Watch for procrastination cues
"Put yourself in new surroundings with few procrastination cues, such as the quiet section of a library "
"Have backup plans for when you still procrastinate. No one is perfect, after all "
"By memorizing material you understand, you can internalize the material in a profound way. And you are reinforcing the mental library you need to become a genuine master of the material "
"Gain trust in your new system. You want to work hard during times of focuses concentration - and also trust your system enough that when it comes time to relax, you actually relax without feelings of guilt"
The memory palace technique - placing memorable nudges in a scene that is familiar to you - allows you to dip into the strength of your visual memory system
"Learning to use your memory in a more disciplined, yet create manner helps you learn to focus on your attention, even as you create wild, diffuse connections that build stronger memories "
Metaphors can help you learn difficult ideas more quickly
Repetition is critical in allowing you to firm up what you want to remember before the ideas fade away
Meaningful groups and abbreviations can allow you to simplify and chunk what you are trying to learn so you can store it more easily in memory
Writing and saying what you are trying to learn seems to enhance retention
Stories - even if they are just used as silly memory tricks - can allow you to more easily retain what you are trying to learn
Exercise is powerfully important in helping your neurons to grow and make new connections
"It may seem intimidating to work alongside other students who grasp material more quickly than you do. But ""average"" students can sometimes have advantages when it comes to initiative, ability to get things done, and creativity "
Brains mature at different speeds. Many people do not develop maturity until their mid twenties
"At some point, after you've got chunked material well in hand (and in brain), you start to let go of conscious awareness of every little detail and do things automatically "
"One trait that successful professionals in science, math, and technology gradually learn is how to chunk - to abstract key ideas "
"Focusing too intently can inhibit the solution you are seeking - like trying to hammer a screw because you think it's a nail. When you are stuck, sometimes it's best to get away from a problem for a while and move on to something else, or to simply sleep on it"
Some of the most formidable heavyweights in science started out as apparently hopeless juvenile delinquents
"Part of the key to creativity is to be able to switch from full focused concentration to the relaxed, daydreamy diffuse mode"
Metaphors and physical analogies form chunks that can allow ideas from very different areas to influence one another
"Regardless of your current or intended career path, keep your mind open and ensure that math and science are in your learning repertoire. This gives you a rich reserve of chunks to help you be smarter about your approach to all sorts of life and career challenges"
"Equations are just ways of abstracting and simplifying concepts. This means that equations contain deeper meaning, similar to the depth of meaning found in poetry "
"Your ""mind's eye"" is important because it can help you stage plays and personalize what you are learning about"
Transfer is the ability to take what you learn in one context and apply it to something else
Multitasking during the learning process means you don't learn as deeply - this can inhibit your ability to transfer what you are learning
"Learning on your own is one the deepest, most effective ways to approach learning:"
"It’s important to grasp the chunked essence of a mathematical concept, because then it’s easier to transfer and apply that idea in new and different ways"
It improves your ability to think independently
It can help you answer the strange questions that teachers sometimes throw at you on tests
"In learning, persistence is often far more important than intelligence "
"Train yourself to occasionally reach out to people you admire. You can gain wise new mentors who, with a simple sentence, can change the course of your future. But use your teachers’ and mentors’ time sparingly"
People are competitive as well as cooperative. There will always be those who criticize or attempt to undermine any effort or achievement you make. Learn to deal dispassionately with these issues
"If you aren't very fast at grasping the essentials of whatever you are studying, don't despair. Surprisingly often, ""slower"" students are grappling with fundamentally important issues that quicker students miss. When you finally get what's going on, you can get it at a deeper level"
"The focused mode can allow you to make critical errors even though you feel confident you've done everything correctly. Rechecking your work can allow you to get a broader perspective on it, using slightly different neural processes that can allow you to catch blunders"
Working with others who aren't afraid to disagree can: 
1. Help you catch errors in your thinking 
2. Make it easier for you to think on your feet and react well in stressful situations
3. Improve your learning by ensuring that you really understand what you are explaining to others and reinforcing what you know 
4. Build important career connections and help steer you toward better choices 
"Criticism in your studies, whether you are giving or receiving it, shouldn't be taken as being about you. It's about what you are trying to understand"
It is easiest of all to fool yourself
Not getting enough sleep the night before a test can negate any other preparation you've done
"Taking a test is a serious business. Just as fighter pilots and doctors go through checklists, going through your own test preparation checklist can vastly improve your chances of success"
"Counterintuitive strategies such as the hard-start-jump-to-easy technique can give your brain a chance to reflect on harder challenges even as you're focusing on other, more straightforward problems"
"The body puts out chemicals when it is under stress. How your interpret your body's reaction to these chemicals makes all the difference. If you shift your thinking from ""This test has made me afraid"" to ""This test has got me excited to do my best!"" it helps improve your performance"
"If you are panicked on a. test, momentarily turn your attention to your breathing. Relax your stomach, place your hand on it, and slowly draw a deep breath. Your hand should move outward, and your whole chest should expand like a barrel"
"Your mind can trick you into thinking that what you've done is correct, even if it isn't. This means that, whenever possible, you should blink, shift your attention, and then double-check your answers using a big-picture perspective, asking yourself, ""Does this really make sense?"""
Your desire to figure things out right now is what prevents you from being able to figure things out
Reshaping your brain is under your control. The key is patient persistence - working knowledgeably with your Brian's strengths and weaknesses 
Ten rules of good studying: 
"1. Use recall. After you read a page in a book, look away and recall the main ideas. An ability to recall - to generate the ideas from inside yourself is one of the key indicators of good learning "
2. Test yourself. On everything. All the time. Flash cards are you friend
3. Chunk your problems. Chunking is understanding and practicing with a problem solution so that it can all come to mind in a flash
"4. Space your repetition. Spread out your learning in any subject a little ever day, just like an athlete. Your brain is like a muscle - it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time"
5. Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice. Never practice too long at any one session using only problem-solving technique - after a while you are just mimicking what you did on the previous problem. Mix it up and work on different types of problems
"6. Take breaks. When you get frustrated with a math or science problem, take a break so that another part of your mind can take over and work in the background "
"7. Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies. Whenever you are struggling with a concept, think to yourself, how can I explain this so that a ten-year-old could understand it?"
"8. Focus. Turn off all interrupting beeps and alarms on your phone and computer, and then turn on a time for twenty-five minutes. Focus intently for those twenty-five minutes and try to work as diligently as you can."
"9. Eat your frogs first. Do the hardest thing earliest in the day, when you are fresh"
10. Make a mental contrast. Image where you've come from and contrast that with the dream of where your studies will take you. 
Ten rules of bad studying:
"1. Passive rereading - sitting passively and running your eyes back over a page. Unless you can prove that the material is moving into your brain by recalling the main ideas without looking at the page, rereading is a waste of time"
"2. Letting highlights overwhelm you. Highlighting your text can fool your mind into thinking you are putting something in your brain, when all you're really doing is moving your hand. "
"3. Merely glancing at a problem's solution and think you know how to do it. Th is one of the worst errors students make while studying. You need to be able to solve a problem step-by-step, without looking at the solution "
4. Waiting until the last minute to study. Would you cram at the last minute if you were practicing for a track meet? Your brain is like a muscle - it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on a subject on a time
"5. Repeatedly solving problems of the same type that you already know how to solve. If you just sit around solving similar problems during your practice, you're not actually preparing for a test - it's like preparing for a big basketball game by just practicing your dribbling"
"6. Letting study sessions with friends turn into chat sessions. Checking your problem solving with friends, and quizzing one another on what you know, can make learning more enjoyable, expose flaws in your thinking, and depend you learning"
7. Neglecting to read the textbook before you start working problems. 
8. Not checking with your instructors or classmates to clear up points of confusion. Professors are used to lost students coming in for guidance - it's our job to help you. The students we worry about are the ones who don't come in. Don't be one of those students 
9. Thinking you can learn deeply when you are being constantly distracted. Every tiny pull toward an instant message or conversation means you have less brain power to devote to learning. Every tug of interrupted attention pulls out tiny neural roots before they can grow
"10. Not getting enough sleep. Your brain pieces together problem-solving techniques when you sleep, and it also practices and repeats whatever you put in mind before you go to sleep. Prolonged fatigue allows toxins to build up in the brain that disrupt the neural connections you need to think quickly and well. If you don't get a good sleep before a test, NOTHING ELSE YOU HAVE DONE WILL MATTER"
